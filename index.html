										Monroe College
									</h2>
									<p>
										I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Information Systems at Monroe College in New York.
									</p>
									<h3>Honors Program</h3>
									<p>
										I've been an active participant in Monroe's Honors Program since my first semester. Each semster I take Honors courses,
										attend field trips, and engage in community service and volunteer work. I've also authored and presented research
										at the Northeast Regional Honors Conference (NRHC) in 2015 and 2016. Additionally, I support and
										represent the Honors Program at open houses, information booths, and at other school events. Through my high involvement in
										the program, I am recognized an ex-officio student board member for the program.
									</p>
									<h3>Residence Life</h3>
									<p>
										As a Resident Advisor (RA), I am one of the people students rely on for information and assistance related to life on
										campus. I am responsible for planning, coordinating, and executing community programs each semester. It's also
										my responsibility to perform housing check-ins and check-outs, filing, and other administrative tasks in the
										Residence Life office. As an RA, I've participated in trainings including: communication, diversity, safety, crisis response,
										incident documentation and reporting, and sensitivity trainings. I've also trained newly onboarded RAs. Being an RA has allowed
										me to develop and utilize my leadership and communication skills, and professionalism through trainings and mentorship from
										the leaders on the Residence Life team.
									</p>
									<h3>IT Student Association</h3>
									<p>
										As President of the IT Student Association, I led and collaborated with a team of seven students to run an organization that
										aims to expose its members to a variety to technologies and their real world applicatons. I negotiated partnerships with other
										organizations, planned and oversaw club outings, and taught at workshops covering topics such as Virtualization, Linux,
										Git/Github, HTML, and CSS. I also successfully spearheaded Monroe's first hackathon.
									</p>

											I am currently a Full Stack Engineering Intern, primarily using Ruby on Rails and Angular 2 to develop
											web applications. Must Win is a Silicon Valley tech consulting startup, founded by early Yammer engineers with a
											"shared ethos of rapid design, development, measurement, and iteration." Working in this kind of environment has allowed me
											to significantly increase my iteration speed. I've been exposed to agile methodologies, continuous integration, microservices architechure,
											and have learned to design and create RESTful APIs, as well as use various tools for testing, debugging, and deploying web applications.

										</h2>
										<p >
											I volunteer at Meals on Wheels of New Rochelle as their Systems Administrator. I offered my talents and time to
											Meals on Wheels as a student who was eager to apply what I was learning in the classroom, and one looking to give back to my
											community. At Meals on Wheels, I troubleshoot network, PC, printer, and fax machine issues. I also recommend and install
											hardware and software that will increase office productivity and decrease operational overhead. I've also conducted
											user training for Windows 10, Office 365, and SharePoint. Additionally, I advise information management and security
											policies and procedures. In Fall 2015, I was unexpectedly awarded by the Mayor of New Rochelle for volunteering my services
											to a vital organigation in the New Rochelle community.

										<p >
                      At Con Edison, I interned as a Systems Analyst where I worked in a heavily project oriented environment. I mainly
											worked on a systems request management system that's responsible for managing IT requests
											from over 260 Environmental Health & Safety personnel who routinely use approximately 30 applications.
											I created and presented project deliverables including a vision and scope document, project plan,
											requirements document, and process map. I also reviewed processes and procedures, and recommended improvements.
											In addition, I was exposed to Microsoft Visio for diagramming, and	SharePoint for creating sites and managing content.
                    </p>
										<p >
											While working at Con Edison, I was able to see first hand how business processes and computer information systems
											support the operational needs and help to fulfil the compliance requirements of the organization. I also participated
											in a number of trainings including Diversity and Inclusion, Customer Satisfaction, Security Awareness, and
											Handling Personally Identifiable Information.

                      Interning at CyberMaster was the first time I applied my technical skills in a business environment.
                      My work mainly involved creating responsive, mobile friendly, web pages using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                      I also used these same technologies, in addition to jQuery, to enhanced web pages by making them more interactive.
                      Additionally, I created email newsletters for both CyberMaster and its clients. I was exposed to content management
                      systems (Joomla and OpenChart), and was responsible for backing up and making changes to clients' websites.
